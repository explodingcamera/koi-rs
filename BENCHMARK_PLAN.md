- based on https://github.com/phoboslab/qoi/blob/master/qoibench.c
- image suite: https://qoiformat.org/benchmark/
- plots using https://docs.rs/plotters/latest/plotters/
- run as black_box to prevent compiler optimizations
- no warmup before benchmarking, always just use the minimum
- add some more transparent images that play well with koi
- use std::time::Instant https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/datetime/duration.html
